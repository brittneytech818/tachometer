## [0.2.0] 2019-04-25

-   Result differences are now reported as an NxN matrix, so that every result
    can be compared to any other result. The `--baseline` flag has been removed,
    since it is no longer necessary.

-   GitHub Check report is now formatted as HTML instead of ASCII.

-   Remove standard deviation column, as it is rarely useful to interpret
    directly.

## [0.1.0] 2019-04-17

-   Initial release.
